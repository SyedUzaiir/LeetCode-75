/*
 *  1768. Merge Strings Alternately
 *  Link:https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-strings-alternately/description/
    Approach / Idea:

    1.Find the lengths of both strings.
    2.Use a loop up to the length of the longer string.
    3.Append characters from word1 and word2 if the index is within bounds.
    4.Return the merged string.

    Complexity Analysis:

    Time Complexity: O(n + m) â€” Loop runs for the length of the longer string.
    Space complexity: O(1)
    Without considering the space consumed by the input strings (word1 and word2) and the output string (result), we do not use more than constant space.
